## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email gitjuicecable@gmail.com with all of the detials of the vulnerability, including a required PoC, the versions that it affects, and your associated Github username.
Make sure to include the keyword "indigester" in the subject line, or else your email will not be seen.
You can expect a repsonse within a month for the initial email (if your email is legitimate, and adheres to the code of conduct).
If you have not recieved a response email from me in a month, then please send a second (no more than 2 in total) email, and open an issue.  You can expect a response within a week.
Once I have responded to you and the issue is legitimate, you can expect bi-weekly updates on the issue, and a weekly response time.

Once a patch is available for a legitimate vulnerability, an issue will be created and closed, containing the full contents of the email chain and the problem resolution.
The patch will contain a comment reference to your Github username, and the issue.
You may create a pull request with the patch, but it has to contain the unique reference number you are given in the response email, otherwise it will not be pulled, and may be rejected.
